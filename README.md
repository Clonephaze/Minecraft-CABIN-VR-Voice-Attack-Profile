# VoiceAttack Profile for Vivecraft

A custom **VoiceAttack** profile designed for **Vivecraft** to make playing modded Minecraft in VR smoother and more immersive. Includes **42 dynamic commands** to interact with inventory, tools, and more â€” without needing a keyboard.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Included
- **VoiceAttack Profile (`.vap`)** â€“ The full command set.
- **Command Sheet (`.html`)** â€“ A mobile-friendly guide to all voice commands.

## ðŸŽ¤ How It Works
Commands use **dynamic syntax**, meaning you can say variations of phrases for the same action. Example:
```
[Open;Close] [Bag;Backpack]
```
This lets you say:
- "Open bag"
- "Open backpack"
- "Close bag"
- "Close backpack"

### ðŸ”¹ Using the Commands
1. **With voice activation:** Just say the command.
2. **Without voice activation:** Say `CABIN` first, then the command.

## ðŸŽ® Required Keybinds
For full functionality, bind these keys in Minecraft:
| Action                  | Key  |
|-------------------------|------|
| Quick Torch            | `'`  |
| Show Keyboard          | `HOME` |
| Open Wireless Terminal | `Page Up` |
| Balance Grid           | `Shift + /` |
| Clear Grid             | `Shift + *` |
| Add Waypoint           | `End` |
| Waypoint Manager       | `Delete` |
| Open Quests            | `` ` `` (Backtick) |
| Open Satchel           | `Page Down` |
| Toggle Movement Mode   | `0` (Zero) |

## ðŸš€ Installation
1. Install **VoiceAttack** (Paid software).
2. Load the `.vap` file into VoiceAttack.
3. Ensure the required keybinds match in Minecraft.
4. Open the command sheet (`.html`) for reference.

## âœ¨ Future Updates
This profile is a work in progress! Expect tweaks and additions as I keep playing.
